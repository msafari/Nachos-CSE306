To run nachos, first make sure you uncomment the line which corresponds to the OS you are compiling it on in the run file.
Next, set the GCCDIR and JAVADIR variables in test/Makefile to point to the binaries and java directories respectively.
Open up a terminal and run `make halt` in the test/ directory. Then run the command `./run  -d m -x test/halt`,
once in the nachos/ dir.
