Notes:
-Options.java stores the options to specify when the program is run. This is where you can add new tests.
Once the tests are added in Options.java, you can start them in Nachos.java.

-Debug.java allows you to add new debug flags to Nachos.
-Removed args for demo, not used anywhere. Then where is the random seed used?
- -d followed by custom arguments will display debug info
- -CT/TM will run those demos
