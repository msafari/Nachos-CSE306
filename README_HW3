RoundRobin:
	Nachos is modified so that by default it uses the round-robin scheduler.
	The round robin scheduler will keep track of the number of ticks gone by through the TimerInterruptHandler's handleInterrupt routine.
	By default handleInterrupt is called every 100 ticks, so the handler has a counter which will be incremented until it reaches 10 (1000 ticks).
	The round robin scheduler has a sleep list which keeps track of the sleeping threads whose sleep time is decreased in the handleSleep() function on each 100 ticks.
	This gives a rough estimate on when the thread should be woken up since its sleep time will be less than or equal to 0.
	
	---- Test programs: ----
	The test program round-robin.c contains an inner loop which is made up of 9 MIPS instructions. The loop can be increased so the scheduler will interrupt the current thread.
	Currently, the inner loop is set to 200 and the outer loop is set to 3 so the number of instructions per each inner loop = 1800, 
	and in total there are 5400 MIPS instructions just for the nested loop.
	
	

Note: If only one thread is left on the readylist, it will run to completion. 
**NOTE: Use -SCH : If you ever want to use the original scheduler that was provided. **


Multi Level Feedback Scheduler:
	use -MLFS to use this scheduler
	use -numPL <> to specify the number of priority levels for the scheduler
	use -highQ <> to specify the highest level quantum.
