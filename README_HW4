Instructions

The nachos filesystem has been switched from the stub to the real one. 
To run any of the tests supply the '-f' flag which will "format" the disk.
Use -d f to see the filesystem debug info.

Since the real file system uses a RandomAccessFile DISK0, 
use -f -cp <first executable> to copy over the compiled executable onto the disk.
Otherwise, it will complain about not being able to open the first file: ./run -f -cp /test/write1 -x test/write1
Make sure that the executable has been succesfully copied over.
Note: When running the program from DISK0, make sure to remove -f and -cp flags.

If file is greater than the max file size, the filesystem will not allocate memory for the file.

TO LIST ALL FILES IN FILESYSTEM:
--------------------------------

	1) Make sure you remove all debug flags so you see a clean list printed.
	2) Run the program with [-list] flag
	3) List of all files will be displayed upon exit.
	NOTE: List will not print the directories and files correctly if we extend the directory for more than 10 files. 
	However, you can check the functionality of our directpry extension by looking through the disk file. It is just an error in the list function.
	
	
Testing Validation:
--------------------

	-V: set this flag to print validation debug statements
	

General Notes For Developers:
- All blocks are 128 bytes
- dataSectors array is different for each type of inode:
	-FileHeader is 30 (28 for direct, 1 for indirect, 1 for doubly indirect ). 30 because two integers are saved already: numBytes and numSectors
	-Indirect and Doubly Blocks have size 32
- To extend a file to a given number of bytes use: dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=NUMBER >> <fileName>
  This is useful when testing the indirect/doubly indirect block allocation.
- To view the disk as an array of characters use: od -c DISK0
