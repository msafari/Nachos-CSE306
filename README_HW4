Instructions

The nachos filesystem has been switched from the stub to the real one. 
To run any of the tests supply the '-f' flag which will "format" the disk.
Use -d f to see the filesystem debug info.

Since the real file system uses a RandomAccessFile DISK0, 
use -f -cp <first executable> to copy over the compiled executable onto the disk.
Otherwise, it will complain about not being able to open the first file: ./run -f -cp /test/write1 -x test/write1
Make sure that the executable has been succesfully copied over.
Note: When running the program from DISK0, make sure to remove -f and -cp flags.

If file is greater than the max file size, the filesystem will not allocate memory for the file.

TO LIST ALL FILES IN FILESYSTEM:
--------------------------------

	1) Make sure you remove all debug flags so you see a clean list printed.
	2) Run the program with [-list] flag
	3) List of all files will be displayed upon exit.

General Notes For Developers:
- All blocks are 128 bytes
- dataSectors array is different for each type of inode:
	-FileHeader is 30 (28 for direct, 1 for indirect, 1 for doubly indirect ). 30 because two integers are saved already: numBytes and numSectors
	-Indirect and Doubly Blocks have size 32
- To extend a file to a given number of bytes use: dd if=/dev/zero bs=1 count=NUMBER >> <fileName>
  This is useful when testing the indirect/doubly indirect block allocation.
- To view the disk as an array of characters use: od -c DISK0
