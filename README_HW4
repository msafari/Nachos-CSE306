Instructions

The nachos filesystem has been switched from the stub to the real one. 
To run any of the tests supply the '-f' flag which will "format" the disk.
Use -d f to see the filesystem debug info.

Since the real file system uses a RandomAccessFile DISK0, 
use -f -cp <first executable> to copy over the first executable onto the disk.
Otherwise, it will complain about not being able to open the first file: ./run -f -cp /test/write1 -x test/write1

General Notes For Developers:
- All blocks are 128 bytes
- dataSectors array is different for each type of inode:
	-FileHeader is 30 (28 for direct, 1 for indirect, 1 for doubly indirect ). 30 because two integers are saved already: numBytes and numSectors
	-Indirect and Doubly Blocks have size 32
