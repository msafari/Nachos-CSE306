/**
 * This abstract class defines the interface to a Nachos file system.
 *
 * A file system is a set of files stored on disk, organized
 * into directories.  Operations on the file system have to
 * do with "naming" -- creating, opening, and deleting files,
 * given a textual file name.  Operations on an individual
 * "open file" (read, write, close) are to be found in the OpenFile
 * class (Openfile.java).
 *
 * We define two separate implementations of the file system:
 * a "real" file system, built on top of a disk simulator,
 * and a "stub" file system, which just re-defines the Nachos file system 
 * operations as operations on the native file system on the machine
 * running the Nachos simulation.
