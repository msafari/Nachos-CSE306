This directory contains a variety of user programs that might be useful
for testing the various Nachos subsystems you develop.  Most of these
test programs were not in the original UC Berkeley C++ version of Nachos,
but they were present in the Rice U. Java version that I downloaded,
and I decided to leave them here.

Most of these programs will not work under the base version of Nachos.
Additionally, due to changes that I made to Nachos and semester-to-semester
variations in the assignment specifications, some of them might not work
even after you have implemented related portions of Nachos.  So, you shouldn't
just try to use these test programs blindly.  Instead, it is best to think
of them as a source of ideas and a starting point for you in developing your
own tests.
